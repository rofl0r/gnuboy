# mygnuboy
My own version of gnuboy emulator


WHEN COMPILING AND INSTALLING:

Remove and insert the following flags in the makefile that gets generated by ./configure:

	NOTICE: all the dashes are part of the commands

	-fforce-mem  -----> must be removed if compilation is not successful
	-std=c99 -----> necessary because there are a few comments starting with //
        -pthread -----> I have implemented pthreads, so it is necessary too


NEW DEPENDENCIES ADDED:


	scrot
	ffmpeg

	Both of them available via apt-get
