1.0.3
fixed a typo in the SDL keymap file that kept . from working
added support for binding keys to the ' key
fixed bug related in nix.c's sys_checkdir that made it always demand writable
fixed loader.c since it depended on this bug
removed the literal newlines inside the copyright string in main.c
removed some parentheses in save.c's macros
(these were perfectly valid but caused problems with a broken compiler, lcc)
added return-type prototypes for strdup since it's not always in string.h
(many of the above were old bugfixes sent in by Damian M Gryski)
added slow, primitive support for gzipped rom files
(thanks to David Madore for the portable inflate code taken from his quine)
various minor source cleanups
more preliminary work on the fast register/himem io routines (not used yet)
fixed HuC3 emulation, according to TGB's sources
added hacks to work around HuC3's IR port not being implemented
(Robopon Sun and Star now seem to run fine)
fixed a few sound inconsistencies after loading a savestate
various fixes to keybinding system and X11 keymap
integrated Jonathan Gevaryahu's color filter
added "gbamode" rcvar to unlock gba-only features in some cgb games
(this has NOTHING to do with gba emulation!)
fixed DMG sprite sorting code! it's now enabled by default
reverted mistaken CGB wave pattern "fix" in 1.0.2
don't always reset sound positions on sound init (is this correct?)

1.0.2 (2001-09-18)
fixed bugs in rc_setvar calls in sys_initpath
fixed multiple definition of cpu struct in cpu.h
corrected behavior of ch1 sweep function when freq is written during sweep
emulated wave pattern corruption to fool "emulator-detectors"
updated savestate code to handle these changes, incremented minor version
(this should not affect compatibility with old savestates)
fixed major bugs in sound channel 4
perfected channel 4 output sequence to sound like a real Gameboy
(much thanks goes out to Lord Nightmare for all his hard work on this!)
default channel 3 square wave is no longer 4 octaves too high
make DI cancel pending HALT...is this correct? (fixes Konami Collection #1)
fixed reversed stereo channels
tweaked frequency cutoff points that prevent aliasing
corrected default wave pattern (noise) when running in dmg mode
fixed sound reset bug that messed up pitch after pausing in Bubble Ghost
added new sample palettes
fixed major interrupt/HALT bug that kept Amazing Penguin from running
fixed sound channel 3 length regiser (info in gbspec.txt is bogus)
tweaked volume of channel 4
removed FFL3 tile glitch from the known bugs in the README
(it was caused by a bad dump and/or hacked rom, not a bug in gnuboy)
added emulation of DMG STAT register write bug (causes interrupt)
(this fixes Legend of Zerd and perhaps one or two other games)
